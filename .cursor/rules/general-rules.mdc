- Documents in the @original-documentation folder are human-written.  These documents should be read but not updated.
- Follow a test-driven methodology.  I will review tests before we start coding the implementation.  Tests should cover the business and non-functional requirements as documented in [business-requirements.md](mdc:original-documentation/business-requirements.md) and [non-functional-requirements.md](mdc:original-documentation/non-functional-requirements.md).
- Document each prompt and the actions you took in response to the prompt in [cursor-logs.md](mdc:cursor-logs.md).
