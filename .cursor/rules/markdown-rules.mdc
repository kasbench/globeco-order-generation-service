- Documentation that you generate should be placed in the @ai-generated-documentation folder.
- You will be asked to write the @execution-plan.md document.  Use @sample-execution-plan.md as a guide for formatting and content.  Note that @sample-execution-plan.md was developed for a Go application and this is a Python application.  Consequently, the technology choices will be different.  However, the types of activities in @execution-plan.md should mirror the sample plan.
- You will be asked to write the [architecture.md](mdc:ai-generated-documentation/architecture.md).  Use [sample-architecture.md](mdc:original-documentation/sample-architecture.md) as an example.  Note that it was written for a Go project and this is a Python project, so techology decisions will differ.
- You will be asked to write [requirements.md](mdc:ai-generated-documentation/requirements.md).  Use [sample-requirements.md](mdc:original-documentation/sample-requirements.md) as an example.
- As you complete steps in the @execution-plan.md, check off the check boxes
