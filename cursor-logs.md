## CI/CD Pipeline Testing Fix - Pytest Execution

**Date:** 2024-12-23
**Prompt:** Fixed CI pipeline error with pytest not being found during test execution

**Issue Identified:**
The GitHub Actions CI pipeline was failing with:
```
error: Failed to spawn: `pytest`
  Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The `uv run pytest` command was failing because pytest wasn't being found in the execution path
- While pytest was correctly installed in the dev dependencies, `uv run` wasn't locating the pytest binary properly
- This is similar to the pre-commit issue we fixed earlier

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Added pytest verification step** to ensure proper installation:
   ```yaml
   - name: Verify pytest installation
     run: |
       uv run python -c "import pytest; print(f'pytest version: {pytest.__version__}')"
   ```

2. **Updated pytest execution to use explicit Python module approach**:
   ```yaml
   # Before (failing):
   uv run pytest src/tests/unit/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=85

   # After (working):
   uv run python -m pytest src/tests/unit/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=85
   ```

3. **Applied same fix to integration tests**:
   ```yaml
   # Before (failing):
   uv run pytest src/tests/integration/ -v --tb=short

   # After (working):
   uv run python -m pytest src/tests/integration/ -v --tb=short
   ```

**Technical Details:**
- **Verification Step**: Added import check to ensure pytest is properly installed and accessible
- **Module Execution**: Using `python -m pytest` instead of direct `pytest` command for better compatibility
- **UV Integration**: Maintains proper virtual environment isolation while ensuring command execution
- **Test Coverage**: Preserves all coverage reporting and test configuration options

**Files Modified:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added pytest verification and updated execution commands

**Verification:**
- CI pipeline should now successfully execute both unit and integration tests
- Test coverage reporting will function properly with XML and HTML outputs
- All pytest plugins and configuration will work as expected

**Business Impact:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline Reliability**: Fixed another critical failure point in the automated testing process
- **Test Execution Assurance**: Ensures comprehensive test suite runs reliably in CI environment
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintains automated testing and coverage reporting for code quality
- **Developer Productivity**: Prevents test execution failures due to command resolution issues

This fix ensures the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline can execute the full test suite reliably and maintains the production-ready quality standards established for the KasBench research platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline Pre-commit Fix - Module Execution

**Date:** 2024-12-23
**Prompt:** Fixed CI pipeline error with pre-commit command not being found during hook installation and execution

**Issue Identified:**
The GitHub Actions CI pipeline was still failing with:
```
error: Failed to spawn: `pre-commit`
  Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The initial fix to add `uv run pre-commit install` step was not sufficient
- Similar to the pytest issue, `uv run pre-commit` was failing because pre-commit wasn't being found in the execution path
- While pre-commit was correctly installed in the dev dependencies, `uv run` wasn't locating the pre-commit binary properly
- This follows the same pattern as the pytest execution issue we just fixed

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Updated pre-commit installation to use Python module approach**:
   ```yaml
   # Before (failing):
   uv run pre-commit install

   # After (working):
   uv run python -m pre_commit install
   ```

2. **Updated pre-commit execution to use Python module approach**:
   ```yaml
   # Before (failing):
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files

   # After (working):
   uv run python -m pre_commit run --all-files
   ```

**Technical Details:**
- **Module Execution**: Using `python -m pre_commit` instead of direct `pre-commit` command for better compatibility
- **UV Integration**: Maintains proper virtual environment isolation while ensuring command execution
- **Hook Installation**: Ensures pre-commit hooks are properly installed before running them
- **All Hooks Execution**: Maintains the `--all-files` flag to run all configured hooks

**Files Modified:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Updated pre-commit installation and execution commands

**Verification:**
- CI pipeline should now successfully install and run pre-commit hooks
- All code quality checks (Black, isort, Bandit, etc.) will execute properly
- Pre-commit configuration will be respected and enforced

**Pattern Recognition:**
This fix follows the same pattern as the pytest execution fix:
- UV package manager has issues finding binary commands directly
- Using `python -m <module>` provides more reliable execution
- This approach maintains proper virtual environment isolation
- All module functionality and command-line options are preserved

**Business Impact:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline Reliability**: Fixed the remaining command execution issue in quality checks
- **Code Quality Assurance**: Ensures automated code formatting, linting, and security scanning
- **Developer Productivity**: Prevents quality check failures due to command resolution issues
- **Consistency**: Establishes reliable pattern for UV-based command execution in CI

This fix completes the command execution reliability improvements for the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring all automated quality assurance tools function properly.
