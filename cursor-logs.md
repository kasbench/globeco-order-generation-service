## Prompt: Review Requirements Documents

**User Request:** Please review the @business-requirements.md and @non-functional-requirements.mdc documents for this project. Are they clear and actionable? Are there any changes I should make before we get started?

**Actions Taken:**
1. Reading the non-functional requirements document to complement the already-provided business requirements
2. Analyzing both documents for clarity, completeness, and actionability
3. Identifying any gaps, ambiguities, or areas that need clarification before development begins

**Follow-up:** User updated documents to address questions 1, 3, and 4. Now requesting recommendation for optimization library (question 2).

**Updates Found in Business Requirements:**
- Added parallelization configuration for rebalances
- Clarified that orders are returned to API caller, not sent directly to Order Service
- Added comprehensive error handling section with timeouts and retry logic

**Recommendation:** CVXPY for optimization library - user accepted and updated non-functional requirements.

## Prompt: Create Architecture Document

**User Request:** Create @architecture.md using @sample-architecture.md as formatting guide, adapted for Python/FastAPI Order Generation Service.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Creating comprehensive architecture document following Clean Architecture and DDD principles
2. Adapting structure for Python/FastAPI technology stack
3. Including specific components for optimization engine, external service integration, and model management

## Prompt: Create Requirements Document

**User Request:** Generate complete requirements for the microservice as @requirements.md, based on @business-requirements.md and @non-functional-requirements.mdc, using @sample-requirements.md as formatting example.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Creating comprehensive requirements document following sample structure
2. Incorporating business requirements for models, rebalancing, and optimization
3. Including non-functional requirements for Python/FastAPI/MongoDB stack
4. Detailing API specifications, data models, and processing requirements

## Prompt: Create Execution Plan

**User Request:** Generate execution plan as @execution-plan.md using @sample-execution-plan.md as example, following test-driven methodology with checkboxes for tracking progress.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Creating comprehensive execution plan adapted for Python/FastAPI/MongoDB technology stack
2. Following test-driven development methodology with tests written before implementation
3. Structuring phases to prioritize testing framework and domain validation
4. Including specific deliverables for optimization engine and mathematical validation
5. Adapting timeline and milestones for investment model management and portfolio rebalancing

## Prompt: Create README Documentation

**User Request:** Before we get started, please generate a @README.md documenting this microservice.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Creating comprehensive README.md with service overview and capabilities
2. Including technology stack, architecture highlights, and getting started guide
3. Documenting API endpoints, development workflow, and deployment instructions
4. Adding contributing guidelines and project information
5. Ensuring accessibility for developers wanting to understand, run, or contribute to the service

## Phase 1: Foundation & Testing Infrastructure (STARTED)

**User Request:** Please proceed with phase 1 of @execution-plan.md

**Phase 1.1: Project Initialization**
**Actions Taken:**
1. Creating Python project structure according to Clean Architecture
2. Setting up pyproject.toml with all required dependencies
3. Creating .gitignore for Python development
4. Establishing directory structure for src/, tests/, and deployment files

**Phase 1.2: Testing Framework Setup âœ… COMPLETED**
**Actions Taken:**
1. Installing development dependencies including pytest, testcontainers, and code quality tools
2. Creating pytest.ini configuration with comprehensive markers and async support
3. Implementing global test fixtures in src/tests/conftest.py with:
   - MongoDB test containers integration
   - Mock external services framework
   - Sample test data fixtures (investment models, portfolios, prices)
   - Mathematical optimization problem fixtures
   - FastAPI test client fixtures
4. Creating test utilities package with:
   - Custom assertions for financial and mathematical validation
   - Test data generators for securities, portfolios, and models
   - Helper functions for test setup and cleanup
5. Implementing infrastructure test to verify testing framework functionality
6. All 10 infrastructure tests passing successfully
7. Coverage reporting configured for 95% threshold
8. Test-driven development framework ready for domain layer implementation

**Status:** Phase 1.2 completed successfully. Testing infrastructure is fully operational and ready for TDD approach in Phase 2.
