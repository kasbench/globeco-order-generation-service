# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing a 500 error when trying to retrieve rebalance records from the database. The error occurs in the repository layer when calling `RebalanceDocument.get_motor_collection()`, which suggests that the Beanie ODM is not properly initialized or there's a timing issue with database connectivity. This feature will implement robust database initialization with proper error handling and validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database initialization to be robust and provide clear error messages, so that I can quickly identify and resolve connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the database connection SHALL be established and validated before accepting requests
2. WHEN Beanie ODM initialization fails THEN the application SHALL log detailed error information and fail to start
3. WHEN database connectivity is lost THEN the application SHALL provide meaningful error responses
4. WHEN the database is not properly initialized THEN repository methods SHALL raise clear exceptions with diagnostic information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive database health checks, so that I can monitor the database connection status and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN it SHALL verify database connectivity and Beanie ODM initialization
2. WHEN the database is healthy THEN the health check SHALL return detailed connection status
3. WHEN the database is unhealthy THEN the health check SHALL return specific error information
4. WHEN Beanie collections are not accessible THEN the health check SHALL detect and report this condition

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the application to gracefully handle database initialization failures, so that I can understand what went wrong and take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database initialization fails THEN the application SHALL log the specific failure reason
2. WHEN Beanie ODM cannot access collections THEN the error SHALL include collection names and initialization status
3. WHEN MongoDB connection fails THEN the error SHALL include connection details (without sensitive information)
4. WHEN the application cannot start due to database issues THEN it SHALL exit with a clear error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want repository methods to have proper error handling for database connectivity issues, so that API endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository method is called and the database is not initialized THEN it SHALL raise a DatabaseConnectionError
2. WHEN Beanie ODM collections are not accessible THEN repository methods SHALL detect this and provide diagnostic information
3. WHEN database operations fail due to connectivity THEN the error SHALL be properly categorized and logged
4. WHEN the API layer receives database errors THEN it SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (503 for connectivity, 500 for other issues)
