# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements standardized HTTP request metrics for the FastAPI-based portfolio rebalancing service to provide consistent observability across the microservices architecture. The implementation will add OpenTelemetry-compatible HTTP metrics that can be exported to the Otel Collector, enabling comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want standardized HTTP request metrics exposed from the service, so that I can monitor request patterns and performance across all microservices consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service receives any HTTP request THEN the system SHALL increment the `http_requests_total` counter with appropriate labels (method, path, status)
2. WHEN the service processes any HTTP request THEN the system SHALL record the request duration in the `http_request_duration` histogram with appropriate labels
3. WHEN the service starts processing an HTTP request THEN the system SHALL increment the `http_requests_in_flight` gauge
4. WHEN the service completes processing an HTTP request THEN the system SHALL decrement the `http_requests_in_flight` gauge

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want to scrape HTTP metrics in Prometheus format, so that I can collect and aggregate performance data for analysis and alerting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a metrics endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL return metrics in Prometheus text format
2. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL include all required metric types (counter, histogram, gauge)
3. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL use the exact metric names specified: `http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration`, `http_requests_in_flight`
4. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL include proper HELP and TYPE declarations for each metric

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want HTTP request duration metrics with appropriate histogram buckets, so that I can analyze response time distributions and set up latency-based alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording request durations THEN the system SHALL use histogram buckets in milliseconds: [5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000]
2. WHEN recording request durations THEN the system SHALL measure from request start to response completion
3. WHEN recording request durations THEN the system SHALL use milliseconds as the base unit
4. WHEN recording request durations THEN the system SHALL include sum and count values for each label combination

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a monitoring dashboard, I want consistent metric labels across all HTTP requests, so that I can filter and aggregate metrics by endpoint, method, and status code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN labeling metrics THEN the system SHALL use uppercase HTTP method names (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
2. WHEN labeling metrics THEN the system SHALL use route patterns instead of actual URLs with parameters (e.g., "/api/models/{model_id}" not "/api/models/123")
3. WHEN labeling metrics THEN the system SHALL convert numeric HTTP status codes to strings ("200", "404", "500")
4. WHEN labeling metrics THEN the system SHALL sanitize sensitive data from paths

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a FastAPI application, I want HTTP metrics collection implemented as middleware, so that all endpoints are automatically instrumented without individual endpoint modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL register HTTP metrics middleware that processes all requests
2. WHEN any HTTP request is made THEN the system SHALL record metrics regardless of endpoint type (API, health checks, static files)
3. WHEN an error occurs during request processing THEN the system SHALL still record metrics with appropriate error status codes
4. WHEN metrics collection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue processing the request normally

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an OpenTelemetry collector, I want metrics exported in a compatible format, so that I can ingest and forward metrics to downstream monitoring systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting metrics THEN the system SHALL follow OpenTelemetry semantic conventions where applicable
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL properly initialize and register all metrics
3. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL minimize performance overhead on request processing
4. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with existing Otel Collector configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for HTTP metrics functionality, so that I can ensure metrics accuracy and reliability across different request scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL verify that all three metric types are created and registered
2. WHEN tests simulate HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL verify counter increments correctly
3. WHEN tests simulate HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL verify histogram records accurate durations
4. WHEN tests simulate concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL verify gauge properly tracks in-flight requests
5. WHEN tests check metric labels THEN the system SHALL verify all labels contain correct values
